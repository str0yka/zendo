**The path to knowledge in every card**

Zendo is an elegant and effective flashcard application built around the proven spaced repetition technique. Discover a mindful approach to learning that helps you retain information longer with less effort.

## âœ¨ Features

- Dual-Sided Cards: Create custom cards with front and back content

- Smart Review System: Cards you find easy disappear for longer periods

- Intuitive Flipping: Simple tap gesture to reveal answers

- Zen-Inspired Design: Clean, distraction-free interface for focused learning

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Zendo uses a sophisticated algorithm based on the spacing effect, a psychological phenomenon where information is better retained when studied a few times over a long span of time.

1. Create cards with questions on the front and answers on the back

2. Review your cards regularly through curated sessions

3. Rate difficulty after each card (Easy/Medium/Hard)

4. Optimize your learning path as easier cards appear less frequently
